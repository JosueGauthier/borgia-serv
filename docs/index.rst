Introduction
============

Borgia is a software to help you manage your student association. 
With it, you can sell products, organize events, keep track of your stocks, etc… 
It will be your best ally to develop your possibilities for your student association.

Borgia has currently been used by several thousand students for more than 5 years, particularly in `Arts et Métiers <https://artsetmetiers.fr/>`__ campuses.
We are actively looking for people to participate in this great adventure, do not hesitate to contact us directly. We have big plans for Borgia (a mobile application, new features, etc.)!
